Laelith is the name of an imaginary medieval-fantasy city created in the 1980s by the editorial team of the French role-playing game magazine Casus Belli. Laelith fundation aims to export Laelith internationally and make it a role-playing playground for everyone with a [website](https://www.laelith.com/)

During my stay at Laelith, I've had several missions :

- Update the source code to the latest version of the libraries (mainly langchain)
- Dev some tests using pytest for the existing code.
- Dev a translation tool in python from English <-> French using the OpenAI API. Is used for the [Laelith wiki](https://wiki.laelith.com/en/start).
- Dev a script to analyse and find every character of a book (Laelith.txt) and then make a short resume of each character. These character will then be used by a script to generate scenarios as a help for MJs.
