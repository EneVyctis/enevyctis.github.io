During my final-year internship at Télécom SudParis, I joined Michelin’s Red Team CERT as an open-source tools developer. I enhanced BloodHound and AzureHound with new features (Microsoft 365 groups, user interactions) and created DelveHound, a Python-based collector requiring fewer privileges than AzureHound.

I also automated deployments with Ansible, delivered Docker-based releases, and set up a secure Nginx portal for analysts. This experience strengthened my ability to quickly learn new technologies (Go, Azure, Ansible, CI/CD) while driving impactful contributions to security operations.
