## Context

### Team:

- Adrien Schroedel
- Myself

This project took place in my second year at TÃ©lecom SudParis for the course "Architecture and Video Game Engine."

### Project Requirements:

- Code a three-dimensional game of "Capture the Flag" on Unity.
- It must be an RTS (similar to Starcraft, Age of Empires, etc.)
- Include at least 8 different units.
- Enemy units must have basic AI.
- The game must have some UI and sounds.
- Other specific requirements (e.g., the unit that has the flag is the king, the king cannot use its spell, etc.)

## Magic Circus:

In the end, our game had nothing to do with a circus, but I thought it was fun to add a theme to our game.

This project was not easy, especially given the time constraints and my very limited knowledge of Unity. Although I'm not a fan of RTS games, I really enjoyed working on this project, perhaps because I focused mainly on game and level design, which was really fun to do.

I don't have much more to say about it since it was a school project, and I mainly did it to pass the exam. However, I definitely learned many things from this project, including Unity, design patterns, and how to use them. I also reflected on user experience through both the UI and the game itself (the game is still quite unplayable, but I have some ideas on how to improve it).
