## Context

### Team

- Valentin Lantigny
- Tawfik Bennani
- Adrien Schroedel
- Myself

The CASSIOPEE projects are projects that span over a period of 4 to 6 months in small teams (<5 people). Each project is professionalizing, we must meet the client's demands, hold progress meetings on average every two weeks (agile methodology), and it requires a constant and personal investment from us since it comes on top of other courses.

## Project Requirements

From drafting the specifications to delivering the product, each student in the team is required to spend around 200 hours on the project.  
The Cassiopée projects vary in nature. In our case, it was about delivering a video game, developed with the Unreal Engine 5, for the Mines-Télécom competitions. The game was supposed to be available to players in July 2024 during the Mines-Télécom oral exams held at Télécom SudParis.  
Finally, in addition to the game engine constraint, we were asked to address the theme of the environment, with the requirement of showcasing the three stages of a revolution: Ridiculous, Dangerous, and eventually Obvious.  
The game could not last more than 15-20 minutes.

### Rupture

Rupture is the culmination of numerous hours of work: learning, planning, modeling, voice acting, writing, and finally coding. I immediately wanted to create a narrative game, not only because I had never done one before, but also because it seemed like a good way to convey a message and control the gameplay duration—two of the constraints imposed on us. Thus, Cooker, the robot we play in the game, was quickly born.

The Ridiculous phase, the first of the three, was also the easiest to implement. We immediately imagined a futuristic world that was far too dependent on technology for its own good, a world where humans had become ridiculously lazy, to the point where everything had to be automated: cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, commuting, maybe even basic needs... who knows?

Then comes the second phase, Danger, represented here by an explosion that occurred at a mineral extraction site. While the disaster in the game is not very credible (you don't really know what happened while playing), it's easy to imagine or even recall similar catastrophes in the real world. The technological needs of the population are barely kept up with by the production of raw materials.

The third phase was the hardest to highlight, and we actually spent quite a bit of time on it—Valentin and I, as we were the ones handling the scenario. I wouldn't say I'm completely satisfied with the storyline, especially its ending, but given the constraints we faced, I believe we made the right compromises. Thus, the last phase only becomes fully understandable during the final words of the scientist... which I will let you discover by playing the demo of our game (see the repo link).

On the technical side, Tawfik impressed us with his character animations and music. Adrien and I contributed a lot to the game's different maps and their specific mechanics. Valentin spent many hours on his final level, the "open world" part where our robot is finally free to explore the world. We are very proud to have been the team, among the three Cassiopée projects on Unreal Engine, that made the most of the engine's capabilities. Of course, the project was ambitious, and our tutor did not hesitate to remind us of that at each meeting. It's clear that we still need another 100 hours or so to truly achieve a game with a quality close to an actual release. But this demo already shows the work accomplished and our intentions for this project: to push as far as possible what we could do with the various constraints, and most importantly, to learn how to manage them!
