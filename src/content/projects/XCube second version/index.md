## Context

Have you heard about XCube? Well, it’s the same project (yeah...) but with different objectives!

As I mentioned, I wasn’t satisfied with how I implemented the multiplayer aspect. Moreover, I wanted to be able to work on the project again from time to time, but the source code was really difficult to read a few months later. I decided to recode it entirely using my favorite game engine at the time: Unity.

Currently, this project covers less than the previous one (no multiplayer yet) but it has a much cleaner code , so adding or removing features can be done much faster if I, or anyone else (since it’s a public repository), want to.

## ImprovedXCube

Gamemodes implemented so far :

- [X] Local

- [X] versus AI
