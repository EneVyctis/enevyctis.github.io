## Context

Have you seen about XCube ? Well, it's the same project (yeah...) but with different objectives !

As I said, I was not satisfied with how I implemented the multiplayer, moreover, I wanted to be able to work again on the project once in a while but the source code was really difficult to read few month later. I've decided to recode it entirely on my favorite game engine at the time : Unity.

Currently, this project covers less than the previous one, no multiplayer yet, but it is much cleaner so adding or removing features can be done way faster if I, or anyone else since it's a public repository, want to.

## ImprovedXCube

Gamemodes implemented so far :

- [X] Local

- [X] versus AI

- [ ] Multiplayer
