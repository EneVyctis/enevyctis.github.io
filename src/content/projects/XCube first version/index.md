## Context

"CSC 3502 module" is a first-year course at Télécom SudParis that consists of a 50-hour-per-person project in groups of four. The choice of the project, the technology, etc., was up to the four of us:

- Thomas FOISSY
- Romain MOREAU
- Valentin LANTIGNY
- Myself

Tutor :

- Michel SIMATIC, professor à Télécom Sudparis

## XCube

XKube (or XCube) is a variant of "Tic Tac Toe," much more strategic and, in my opinion, more fun.

We used Java as the programming language, and the game runs using libGDX. The multiplayer is coded using a Node.js server that I developed entirely by myself, following and adapting some tutorials. It was my first time doing something like this, so I’m pretty sure it’s the worst server code you’ve ever seen. Yet, it works, and given that I had only 50 hours, it was more than enough for me!

The server is currently down, and I’m not planning on setting it up anytime soon. You’ll have to edit and build the code yourself on localhost if you want to test it.

What else can I say? Please visit the official repo and try it for yourself—the local and AI game modes can be quite challenging. By the way, the game also works on mobile.

Well, that’s all for this short project, which earned us 20 out of 20 points as a final grade.
