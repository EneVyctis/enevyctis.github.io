## XKube

XKube (or XCube) is a variant of the "Tic Tac Toe", way more stategic and, in my opinion, more fun.

We used java as a coding language, the game runs using libGDX, the multiplayer is coded using a node.js server that I coded all by myself following and adapting some tutorials. It was my first time doing something of the sort so i'm pretty sure it is the worst server code you've ever seen. Yet, it runs and with only 50 hours, it was more than enough for me !

The server is currently closed and I'm not planning on setting in up anytime soon, you'll have to edit and build the code yourself on localhost if you want to test it.

What else can I say ? please visit the official repo and try for yourself, the local and AI gamemode can be quite challenging. The game also works on mobile by the way.

Well, that's all for that short project that got us 20 out of 20 points as a final grade.
